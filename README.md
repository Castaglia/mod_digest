proftpd-mod_digest
==================

ProFTPD module implementing the `XCRC`, `XMD5`, `XSHA1`, and `XSHA256` commands,
for calculating the digests (_a.k.a_ *checksums*) of files on the FTP server.
These can be used by FTP clients for verifying that the files that have been
uploaded (or downloaded) match exactly the files on the server.

See the [mod_digest.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Castaglia/proftpd-mod_digest/blob/master/mod_digest.html) documentation for more details.
